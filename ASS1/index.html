    <p>A car, also known as an automobile, is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars have become an integral part of modern life, offering a convenient and efficient means of travel. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from compact city cars to large SUVs and luxury sedans. Modern cars are equipped with advanced technologies such as GPS navigation systems, automatic climate control, and safety features like airbags and anti-lock braking systems. The automotive industry is continually evolving, with a growing focus on electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid cars that aim to reduce environmental impact. Whether for daily commuting, road trips, or leisure activities, cars provide flexibility, independence, and comfort to their users.</p>
